    GoGCM Status
========================================

Currently, the GoGCM code repository is quite small. There is an
example program (gcm.go) in the main directory. Eventually, this is
where the main code will go for the GoGCM project. There is an example
directory where code is being added for demonstration purposes. See
the blog for descriptions of the example models.
